# Renaming a gateway appliance

Network gateways are given unique names that assist users in their identification. At any time, you can change a gateway name using the instructions here. It is recommended that you use a consistent naming convention to more easily identify gateways.
{: shortdesc}

Perform the following procedure to rename a network gateway:

1. [Access the Gateway Appliance Details page](/docs/gateway-appliance?topic=gateway-appliance-viewing-gateway-appliance-details) in the IBM Cloud console.
2. Click the **Actions** menu and select **Rename Gateway**.
3. Enter the new gateway name in the **Gateway Name** field.
4. Click **OK** to save the change.

After changing a gateway appliance's name, the name immediately changes at the top of the Gateway Appliance Details page. You can change the gateway name at any time by repeating these steps.

Changing the name of the gateway appliance in the IBM Cloud console does not automatically change the hostname within the Virtual Router Appliance or any DNS entries that you might have. Changing the hostname requires manual intervention.
